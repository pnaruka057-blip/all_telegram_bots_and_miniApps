                            class="text-ghblue-500 hover:underline">@GroupHelpAdvanceBot</a>, one of our main priorities
                        is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is
                        collected and recorded by Group Help Advance.</p>
                </header>

                <section class="prose prose-sm dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not
                        hesitate to contact us using the Support button in the Bot or through our email (see
                        <strong>Contact</strong> below).</p>

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for users who come into
                        contact with our Telegram bots with regards to the information that they share and/or that
                        Telegram provides to Group Help Advance related to them. This policy is not applicable to any
                        information collected offline or via channels other than these Telegram bots.</p>

                    <h3>Lawful bases</h3>
                    <p>We do not ask for your prior consent in relation to the data that is saved when that information
                        is essential to provide the services to the groups that use our bot. The lawful bases we rely on
                        for processing your information are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We offer a public service for the protection of Telegram groups. Telegram does not offer
                            automatic group protection by itself, so our bot acts in the public interest by providing a
                            mostly free protection service.</li>
                        <li>The manual group management functions provided directly by Telegram are incomplete or hard
                            to use: our bot facilitates administrators’ actions to protect their groups, compensating
                            for platform shortcomings.</li>
                        <li>We pursue the legitimate interest of groups and their administrators who use our services
                            for group safety and management.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Data we collect and why</h3>
                    <p>To provide our services we need to collect some information. For each data type we describe how
                        we collect it, why we collect it, who can access it, and retention periods.</p>

                    <h4>Account information</h4>
                    <p>We store account information such as Telegram ID, name, surname, username, bio, language and the
                        date of the last update of this data in our database. These values are provided by the Telegram
                        API when you interact with our bots (join a group, send a message, start a private bot
                        conversation, or when a command references your username).</p>
                    <p>Some fields (e.g., bio) may not always be saved. These data are retained as long as your Telegram
                        account exists and up to 20 years after its eventual cancellation. They are used to allow bot
                        commands by id/username (for example <code>/ban</code>, <code>/mute</code>, <code>/info</code>)
                        to work properly. Certain commands make this information visible to group staff (for example via
                        <code>/info</code>). Telegram profile data are public in Telegram.</p>

                    <h4>Group participation data</h4>
                    <p>We record which groups your account was present in, your group status (member, restricted,
                        banned, left), number of messages, date of last detected message and date of joining. These
                        values are supplied by the Telegram API and retained while your account exists on Telegram (and
                        up to 20 years after cancellation). They enable commands such as <code>/list</code>,
                        <code>/inactives</code> and group staff tools. Group staff may retrieve these items only for
                        data about that group.</p>

                    <h4>Administration & roles</h4>
                    <p>If you are owner or administrator in a group our bot will save your admin status, permissions and
                        custom title. Those are obtained via the Telegram API and retained while you hold the role (and
                        until the local copy is refreshed, typically within 48 hours for active groups). This data
                        allows administrators to use the commands they are entitled to and to manage the bot via private
                        chat.</p>
                    <p>You cannot request deletion of this information when it is necessary to provide the public
                        service. To remove such data, leave groups where you are admin and where our bot is present.</p>

                    <h4>Roles & custom roles</h4>
                    <p>We save roles (co-founder, moderator, chat cleaner, muter, helper, free user, group custom role),
                        possible custom title and expiry date for the role. Data are retained while the role exists and
                        up to 20 years after account deletion. This supports role-based permissions and the
                        <code>/staff</code> command.</p>

                    <h4>Warns and disciplinary records</h4>
                    <p>We store warns you receive in groups, when you received them and their expiry. These records are
                        retained until removed by group managers or expired, and while your account exists on Telegram
                        (and up to 20 years thereafter). They are required for warning systems and accessible by group
                        staff for that group only.</p>

                    <h4>Bot clones, PRO/ULTRAPRO, purchases and transactions</h4>
                    <p>We store data related to bot clones you created (username and token), groups where you activated
                        PRO/ULTRAPRO features and purchase records (type of service, transaction IDs for Stripe, PayPal,
                        Telegram Stars, crypto transaction IDs where provided). These records remain until you request
                        deletion; removing them may disable paid features.</p>

                    <h4>Captcha & pending-join data</h4>
                    <p>When you join a group with a captcha active we temporarily store the fact you joined, captcha
                        expiry and your group permissions at the time. These temporary records are retained up to 30
                        minutes to allow captcha resolution. If unresolved, some related records may be stored up to 2
                        months to allow rejoin/resolution flows.</p>

                    <h4>Personal blacks / blocklists</h4>
                    <p>We store Personal Blacklist information created or administrated by users. These are retained
                        while the blacklist exists. Imported blacklists may be visible to group members where imported.
                        For safety reasons, certain blocklist data cannot be deleted on user request.</p>

                    <h4>Support messages</h4>
                    <p>We keep a record of messages you send to Support (date, content, reason, related group and
                        resolution flags). These are used to provide and improve support and retained while your account
                        exists (and up to 20 years after cancellation).</p>

                    <h3>Where data is stored & who can access it</h3>
                    <p>Data are stored on servers located in the European Union. Data may be accessed by our Bot Staff
                        for support, verification of abuse or to provide the service. Group staff may access data that
                        relates to their group (for moderation and management only).</p>

                    <h3>GDPR Rights</h3>
                    <p>Every user is entitled to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Right to access:</strong> You may request copies of your personal data (full or
                            partial). One free copy every 30 days; further copies may incur small fees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You may request deletion of personal data. Some data,
                            necessary for public service operation, cannot be deleted. You may request deletion once
                            every 30 days for free; additional requests may incur small fees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You may complain to the competent supervisory
                            authority if you believe processing violates the law.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you make a request, we have 30 days to respond.</p>

                    <h3>Children's information</h3>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. If you
                        believe such data exists in our bots, contact support and we will remove it promptly.</p>

                    <h3>Blocklist and safety</h3>
                    <p>We maintain a global Blocklist managed by our Bot Staff. Reasons and evidence for blocklist
                        entries are recorded. Blocklist entries are stored as long as needed for group safety (and may
                        be kept up to 20 years). Inclusion in the Blocklist is not removable by normal users; appeals
                        should be sent to Support.</p>
